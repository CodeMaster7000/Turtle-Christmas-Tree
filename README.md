# Turtle-Christmas-Tree
Merry Christmas everyone! To celebrate, I have coded a programme where a turtle draws your Christmas tree. Run `python3 Christmas Tree.py` in a terminal if you have Python 3.

NOTE: This repository has been updated on 29/11/2021 as the license had to be edited. The code, however, has remained the same as before.
